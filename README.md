# QuizAppJava
This is a simple Java Quiz app based on Java Swing. The purpose of this app is to take small quizzes for a handful of students. Once you setup the questions just compile the java program to make your working app. 

You can make jar from the source code to make it executable (with dependency) on any PC.
